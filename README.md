# SERVE
Serve is a web platform designed to enable seamless mobile transactions for businesses and individuals. It manages the payroll of a business at any size with little human inputs preventing errors in payroll management. Individuals can make mobile money transactions to family and friends easily. 

# Motivation
Today there's been a major change in how money is transferred and received as technologies are been built to improve financial transaction. As a result I built Serve to join this trend that's making a great impact in our society today. I observerd the impacts other technologies where making and equally discovered their level of inclusion, although high it has not been reached over 50% of the Nigerian population hence my contribution.

# Getting Started
To get started with using this application, you must create an account within the application. The account is free and requires you to own only a digital deveice. Currently the application purposes the ability to only manage the payroll activities of businesses at any scale. Once an account has been created employess can login into their accounts to track salary and allowance payment, create payslips, request loans or leave and make complaints regarding any issue to their respective comapany's administrator. In subsequent updates features will be added to support individual transactions
